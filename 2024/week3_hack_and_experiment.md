# Week 3 - Hack and Experiment

1. Your code doesn't have to be pretty or have many functions, but should be presentable and runnable.
2. Don't reinvent the wheel, use existing libraries and tools.
3. Don't be afraid to ask for help from a mentor, but try to solve the problem yourself first.
4. Prepare your presentation and be ready to explain your code and how it works.
